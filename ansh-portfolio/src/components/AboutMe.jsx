          <p>
            I'm a Software Engineering student at the University of Texas at Dallas with a deep interest in AI, systems programming, and applied machine learning. I enjoy building high-impact tools, from intelligent assistants to low-level performance-driven software. I'm currently focused on research and development that bridges software engineering with machine learning, and Iâ€™m always eager to take on technically challenging and meaningful work.
